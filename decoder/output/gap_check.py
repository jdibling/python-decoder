    """  gap-check meta decoder

            gap-check is a meta-decoder that finds sequence gaps
            in a stream.  Gaps are identified as they are found,
            and printed to stdout.  There's also an option to write
            a file with every gapped packet.  That file will contain
            the msg sequence number that was gapped, along with the
            timstamp of the next packet we got.  (We have no way
            of knowing what time a packet was sent if we never got
            it.  ha ha)

            A "meta-decocer" is a class that implements the
            Decoder interface, but it doesn't actually process
            raw data.

            Instead, it's intended to be the last link in the
            decoder chain, and compute some statistics gathered
            from the links before it.
